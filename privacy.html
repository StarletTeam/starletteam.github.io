We want to give you a full understanding on what we do with your data, what type of data we collect, why we collect it and if there's anything else we do with it. Trust is important.

            <h1>Subscriptions</h1>
            <p>Starlet is a Discord bot that can operate in any Discord server but commands on Starlet cannot be used until a subscription is started. You can start your subscription on Starlet by using the <small>/subscription</small> command on Starlet. For subscriptions, we use a third-party payment provider called Stripe.

Once your subscription has started, we store your <bold>Stripe Subscription ID</bold>, the fact that the payment was processed through Stripe <bold>Subscription Payment Processor Type</bold>, the Discord User ID of the user who initiated the <small>/subscription</small> command and the Guild ID of the server. This data is stored in a secure database that only Prevail Media Interactive has access to. Once the subscription ends, this data will be deleted within 30 days. For more questions on subscriptions and your data, you can request a log of your subscription data in our databases by contacting us at subdata@starlet.gg.

            <h1>What data do you collect</h1>
            <p>To create a safe and fair environment for the businesses, brands, content creators, streamers and musicians who and can come to use Starlet, we employ verification measures to enhance the user experience and security.

The data in question is only saved in Starlet databases and servers. This data can all be requested through email at gdpr@starlet.gg. Expected responses can be 7 days.</p>

            <li><b>TikTok Username</b>: Users on Starlet can submit video analytics coming from their videos so creators, musicians, brands and businesses can view the performance and convert that to success coming to their brand identities. Before submissions are done, the user will have to verify the TikTok username the video (where the analytics would be coming from) is coming from. Once verification is successful, the username will be saved as a cached reference linked to their digital profile on Starlet. This data can also be accessed on Starlet by using the <b>/stats</b> command. Creator teams (moderators, administrators) with elevated Discord Guild permissions can view this data by doing <b>/adminstats</b>.</li>
           <li><b>TikTok Creator ID</b>: Similar to how TikTok usernames are saved, the TikTok Creator ID is also saved. When a user submits a video to Starlet, Starlet will verify if the video contains a TikTok User ID that has been verified with the user on Discord.</li>

All data collected from TikTok is publically accessible without authorization and shall and is treated as public data. Video IDs are removed out of circulation after the creator has decided to suspend compensation for the analytics from said Video ID.
