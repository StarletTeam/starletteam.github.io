Official website for Starlet's privacy policy hosted on GitHub Pages

# Why is Prevail Media Interactive hosting their privacy policy on GitHub Pages
As we work on creating the next generation of tools on Starlet, we're also making that statement relevant for our website. At this very moment in time, we want to make sure that all creators, brands, innovators and musicians and creatives on Starlet know what data they're providing. As we don't have a website at the moment, we wanted to host it on GitHub Pages for the time being.
